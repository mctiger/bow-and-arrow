This game is a remake of the old Win95 game named Bow & Arrow.
This remake is entireley written in Common Lisp. 
This package has just 2 dependencies : lispbuilder-sdl, cl-fad
You can get lispbuilder-sdl with Quicklisp.
So, if you want to play :
(ql:quickload "lispbuilder-sdl")
(asdf:oos 'asdf:load-op :bow-and-arrow) 
(bow-and-arrow:play)

Note : This package is theoretically portable. We just tested the package on
sbcl/linux, ccl/linux, clisp/linux and cmucl/linux.
We have implemented just the first level. So, the following levels will come
soon.
